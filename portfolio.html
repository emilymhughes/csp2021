    <center><h2> As you can see, this is a portion of code from our 1.1.9 project called pizza maker. Essentially, if you press a certain key associated with a pizza topping (for ex. n for onions) then it will appear wherever the cursor is on the pizza. This project was super fun.  </h2></center>

     <center><h2> This is a tik tac toe multiplayer interactive game. Basically the players choose which square to place an 'X' or 'O' at by putting a number into the game console that correlates with said square. As you can see, player 1 who was X won. This was a simple code for a simple, traditional game. I loved this project! </h2></center>
